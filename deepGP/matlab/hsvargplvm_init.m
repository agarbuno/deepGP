    % initialisation for each level.
    % The values of this field are either strings, so that [@initX 'Embed']
    % is called, or it can be a matrix of an a priori computed latent space.
    % Other options for embedding:
    % 'pca','isomap2','vargplvm','fgplvm','outputs','leafOutputs'. The 'outputs' requires that
    % Q==D and initialises X=Y where the data is scaled so that it's 0 mean
    % 1 variance (unless nondefault arguments are passed in stackedInitOpt). The

    % 'separately', means apply the initX function to each
